# Four Pillars of Geometry

Reading John Stillwell's "Four pillars of geometry". The philosophy of the book is to lay geometry through 4 different perspectives, each perspective includeing a concrete chapter and an abstract one. The four pillars are:

- Euclid style constructions
- Linear algebra
- Projective geometry
- Transformation groups
