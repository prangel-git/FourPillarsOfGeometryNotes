The introduction of coordiante systems by Descartes and Fermat gives a model for Euclidean geometry. Although Descartes saw the coordinate system as a realization of geometry, the advent of non-euclidean geometries compels us to prove that the cartesian plane indeed satisifies euclids axioms. This program is called the _arithmetization of geometry_.

Two advantages of this approach:

1. Describes algebraically what points are constructible by straightedge and compass, which leads to proofs that certain constructions are not possible.

2. Allows to define movement of objects in the plane, which provides justification for Euclid's proof of SAS.

The discovery of coordinates is considered a turning point of mathematics because it opens a vast new panorama of geometry. For example:

- Allows for the description of curves by equations leading to algebraic geometry.
- Allows for the study linear equations leading to linear algebra.
- Kickstarts the study of transformations which draws on group theory.
