The concept of distance can be handled in coordinate systems because the distance between two points is an algebraic function (it only includes addition, subtraction, products, and taking a square root)

On the other hand, calculating the angle between two lines requiere the use of arc tangents (which is not an algebraic function). Therefore, to stay in the world of algebra, we work with slopes instead of angles. 

If line $L_1$ has slope $t_1$ and line $L_2$ has slope $t_2$, the **relative slope** between $L_1$ and $L_2$ is given by 

$$
\pm
\left|
\frac{t_1-t_2}
{1+t_1t_2}
\right|
$$

The definition comes from the formula for the tangent of subtracting two angles. The plus or minus sign comes because there are two possible relative slopes (there are also two possible angles) between two lines.
