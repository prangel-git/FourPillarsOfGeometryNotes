### Theorem

Every isometry $f$ is completely determined by the image $f(A)$, $f(B)$ and $f(C)$ of three non colinear points $A$, $B$ and $C$.

#### Proof idea

Any point $P$ is completely characterized by its distance to three non colinear points $A$, $B$ and $C$. Therefore $f(P)$ is completely characterized by $f(A)$, $f(B)$ and $f(C)$.

### Theorem

Every isometry can be constructed from at most three reflections.

#### Proof idea

Use one reflection $r_A$ to move $A$ to $f(A)$, another reflection $r_B$ to move $r_A(B)$ to $f(B)$, and the last reflection to move $r_B(r_A(C))$ to $f(C)$.

One needs to check that each new reflection does not move the previously moved points.
