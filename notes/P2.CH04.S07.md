The imaginary number $i$ is a number that satisfies $i^2=-1$. The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ are numbers of the form $a+ib$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Therefore, the set of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ can be identified with $\mathbb{R}^2$.

We can define multiplication of complex numbers by following the rules of algebra and recalling that $i^2=-1$. This leads to 

$$
(a+bi)(c+di)=(ac-bd)+i(ad+bc)
$$

If we consider $c+id$ as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then this product can be considered as the following multiplication by a matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c  \\
d 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This suggests that the complex number $a+ib$ can also be thought as the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{bmatrix}$.

Matrices are linear transformations. One can check that this matrix corresponds to rotations and amplification of vectors. Namely:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{bmatrix}
=
r
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ and $\theta$ is the angle of the vector $(a, b)$.

This gives us a geometric interpretation of complex number multiplication as a rotation followed by an amplification of a vector.
