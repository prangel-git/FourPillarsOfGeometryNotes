- Finding the intersection of two lines is the same as solving for a point satisfying both line equations. In this case, we can get either no solutions (when the lines are parallel) or one solution.

- Finding the intersection of two circles is the same as solving for points satisfying both circle equations. In this case, we get a quadratic formula with no solutions (in the reals), one solution, or two solutions (depending on how many times the two circles intersect)

- Similarly, one can find the inteserction of a circle and a line by solving for points satisfying both the equation of the line and the equation of the circle.

# Algebraic criteria of constructability

A point is constructable (starting from $0$ and $1$) if and only if its coordinates are obtainable from the number $1$ and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.
