With respect to the $x-y$ axis, the pythagorean theorem suggests that the distance between a pair of points $P_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2=(x_2,y_2)$ should be given by 

$$
d(P_1,P_2)= \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}
$$

We take this _sensible_ definition of distance as our definition. 

# Equation of a circle

A circle with center $(a,b)$ and radius $r$ is the set of points at distance $r$ from $(a,b)$. Therefore the equation of a circle is

$$
(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2
$$

# Equidistant line to two points

The set of points that are at the same distance to two points $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_2,b_2)$ forms a line with equation:

$$
2(a_2-a_1)x+2(b_2-b_1)y+(b_1^2-b_2^2)=0
$$
