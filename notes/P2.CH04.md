We abstract the operations of adding $2$-dimensional vectors, and scaling one vector into the concept of a **vector space**. Such abstraction allows us to prove many classic theorems in an algebraic way. 

To get algebraic descriptions of the concept of distance and angle, we introduce the inner product of a vector space.
