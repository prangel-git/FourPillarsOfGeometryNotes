An **isometry** is a function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ that preserves distance. Namely, for any pair of points $P_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2=(x_2,y_2)$, 

$$
d(P_1,P_2) = d(f(P_1), f(P_2))
$$

Each isometry is one of the following ones:

- Translation
- Rotation of an angle around a point
- Reflection over a line
- Glide reflection: A reflection followed by a translation in the direction of the line of reflection.
